# My Code Wars Repository
## Introduction
This is my repository of daily Code Wars work. I have sorted the files by month, with each month file containing comments that detail the daily problem sets.

## How It's Made
Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#
<br></br>
This is a simple repository that is mainly JavaScript files and C# projects with each Code Wars problem annotated by day.

## Optimizations
Future optimizations include creating a website design to display each Code Wars month file after the user selects the respective file.

## Lessons Learned
I initially began coding straight away on the problem. Through the various iterations of this project, I have used different templates. I have currently landed at the PREP model to solve these problems, going through the steps of parameters, returns, examples, and pseudocode. This allows me to deliberately work through each problem, fully understanding what is being asked before I begin coding. I have found this to be key in being efficient and effective in solving any coding problem.
